# Keep

Keep is a general purpose platform that is designed to facilitate data collection and analysis while providing a robust API to support its use in other mediums.

## Forms

The data collection is defined through forms.  The form structure itself is based on [XForms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XForms).  Specifically, the OpenRosa subset.  While xforms are originally an xml specification, there is now a JSON representation for them, and both formats are available for use through our API. XForms can created using XLS documents as well with our system.  need documentation of JSON Form)

# Getting Started

# Setting Up Your Dev Environment
Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- MongoDB ( http://www.mongodb.org )
- MySQL ( http://www.mysql.com )
- Python 2.7 ( http://www.python.org )

## Frontend Dev Environment
**You must setup Frontend Dev even if you're only doing backend development.**
The Front-end development environment will set up the resources needed to compile
and minify your frontend assets. To correctly ensure that you have a working local
development environment, follow these instructions:

### Install Node.js requirements
Make sure you are in the root of the project where the package.json file is located.

    npm install

### Alternative npm and Node.js Installation
If you are having problems with installing npm, or installing Node.js, try typing the following lines into the command line:

    echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
    . ~/.bashrc
    mkdir ~/local
    mkdir ~/node-latest-install
    cd ~/node-latest-install
    curl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1
    ./configure --prefix=~/local
    make install  #This will take a couple minutes to run
    curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

### Install Javascript/CSS dependencies
Next we make sure bower ( a javascript/css package manager ) is installed and
accessible globally. You may need admin access to install globally.

    (sudo) npm install -g bower
    bower install

### Build Front-End
Finally, we used the tools we have just installed to build our javascript/css
files. When the build task is completed, grunt will watch for changes in the
frontend directory and rebuild when necessary.

    grunt build

## Backend Dev Environment
Make sure you have the following Python modules installed:

- pip ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip )
- virtualenv ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv )
- virtualenvwrapper ( http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper )

Ensure that virtualenvwrapper is correctly setup. You should be able to run
mkvirtualenv_help from the command line.

### Install and Run Redis
In addition to the Python modules, redis is also a required install for this project.

- redis ( http://redis.io/download )

If it is installed this way, run redis from the installation directory with

    src/redis-server

Or, if you feel comfortable with the command line:

    sudo apt-get install redis-server

Then just run

    redis-server

### Create your development workspace
    mkvirtualenv dhlab_backend
    pip install -r deps.txt

### Initializing Submodules
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

### Startup MongoDB
Run mongod to ensure MongoDB is running

    mongod

### Setting up the Databases
    python keep_backend/manage.py syncdb
    python keep_backend/manage.py migrate
    fab restore_db

After running these commands, there should be a sqlite file at ./local.db and a mongodb database
most likely at either /data/db/ or /var/lib/mongodb/.  The mongo database might not be located
at either location, check the --dbpath in the mongodb.conf file for the general location.

**Note:** on a syncdb command, Django will ask you to create a superuser.  Create one, and use these as your login credentials for the Logging in portion.

### All Server Prereqs
All the following must be running before starting the server:

    mongod
    redis-server
    python manage.py celeryd worker -E

If you are editing any static, coffeescript, or javascript files, the following should also be
running:

    grunt build

### Running the Django server
    python keep_backend/manage.py runserver

### Logging In
You may now log in to the system using the following credentials.

**Username:** admin

**Password:** test
